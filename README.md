This site is currently being redone using Gatsby and better SEO techniques.

Everything below if the old README while I work on setting up the new site.







Hello, reader! This is a website created for my screen printing business. It's also where I practice programming concepts in an environment that actually affects sales/profits. The site is created with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS and hosted on Netlify.

## Significant Implementations (and things I've learned along the way):

- ### SEO
My knowledge in SEO is only a sliver of what's possible, but learning about SEO and how the technical side of things translates to actual sales and profit is something that is invaluable to me. I am now more confident in understanding why my lines of code generates business.

- ### Efficient UI/UX
My customers come from many different backgrounds, are vastly different ages, and sometimes do not speak english. It was important to me to make the website easy to navigate for everyone. I've also made sure that the site is responsive and works across all device sizes.

- ### Hosting/Form Handling
While I had experience linking my domain to hosting services in the past, Netlify has the ability to handle forms which is something that I learned while building out the quotes page.
