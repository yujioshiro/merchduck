Hello, reader! This is a website created for my screen printing business. It's also where I practice programming concepts in an environment that actually biaffects sales/profits. The site is created with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS and hosted on Netlify. While I don't want to use this readme as an ad, you can check out what I've built at [merchduck.com](https://merchduck.com).

## Significant Implementations (and things I've learned along the way):


- ### API Calls
The pricing and quote pages of my website allow potential customers to price out their custom order. A large part of the total price is the price of each blank. To display accurate pricing for my services, the website gets current pricing and stock from my supplier's API. It is then calculated into total estimate in realtime so the customer can make adjustments where necessary.

- ### SEO
My knowledge in SEO is only a sliver of what's possible, but learning about SEO and how the technical side of things translates to actual sales and profit is something that is invaluable to me. I am now more confident in understanding why my lines of code generates business.

- ### Efficient UI/UX
My customers come from many different backgrounds, are vastly different ages, and sometimes do not speak english. It was important to me to make the website easy to navigate for everyone. I've also made sure that the site is responsive and works across all device sizes.

- ### A11y (Accessibility)
To really make a website that everyone can use, I studied The A11y Project heavily and implemented as many points on the [The A11y Project checklist](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/) as possible.

- ### Hosting/Form Handling
While I had experience linking my domain to hosting services in the past, Netlify has the ability to handle forms which is something that I learned while building out the quotes page.
