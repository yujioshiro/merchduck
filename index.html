    <dl id="faq" style="display:none">

      <dt>Where is your shop located?</dt>
      <dd>We print in a garage right off the 5 and Lake Forest (by the Subaru Dealership). Please contact us if you are interested in coming in and feeling different garments and prints.</br>
      </br>
      The lack of a physical storefront means the money we save on overhead can be passed onto you.</dd>
      <dt>Is there a minimum order quantity?</dt>
      <dd>There is no minimum quantity to make an order, but there is an initial $32 setup fee for all screen printed orders. Each additional color and logo will incur a $12 fee.</dd>

      <dt>Can you deliver my order to _______?</dt>
      <dd>100+ piece orders can be delivered within Orange County for free and within the Southern California Region for a fee based on mileage.</dd>

      <dt>Do you print all merchandise in house?</dt>
      <dd>All screen printing and DTF orders will be created in house. We have a working relationship with many suppliers across the country and can produce any merchandise your business needs at an affordable price.</dd>

      <dt>Do you offer special pricing for nonprofit organizations?</dt>
      <dd>If your organization or event is registered as a 501(c)(3) with the IRS, please mention this in your initial order form with proof and we can offer you a discounted quote. Unfortunately, we cannot offer charity discounts if your organization is not registered as a 501(c)(3).</dd>
